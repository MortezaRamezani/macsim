\subsection{Detailed Description}
Thread start information. structure which tells when each thread is ready to be started. this is how the simulator works -\/ during trace generation, for each thread, the instruction count of the main (parent) thread when the thread was created is written to a file. during simulation, a thread is ready to be started only when the main thread has executed the number of instructions specified for that thread in the file generated earlier.
