Note

  1. As the pin version changes, we need to consider few things.
     Ideally, everything should be okay, but sometime there are
     changes in the xed files (especially opcode or instruction
     category). In this case, we need to update few fields in the
     pintool as well as the simulator.

     1) Sanity check will be failed if there are changes.

     2) The compilation might be failed as well.

     Here are steps to modify the pintool.

     $PINHOME/extras/xed2-intel64/include/xed-iclass-enum.h

     Simulator
       trace_read.h : 

         1) enum TR_OPCODE_ENUM

       trace_read.cc :
     
         1) init_pin_convert
         2) g_tr_reg_name
         3) g_tr_opcode_names
